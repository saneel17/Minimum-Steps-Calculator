# Minimum-Steps-Calculator-
A Java program for a game to calculate minimum steps to win. The game is as follows: starting with a pile of n tokens, a player removes tokens from the pile until only one token is left, subject to the following rules:  It is always possible to remove exactly one token per move  If the number of tokens in the pile is divisible by 2, you can remove half of the tokens  If the number of tokens in the pile is divisible by 3, you can remove all but one-third of the tokens.
The objective of the game is to reduce the number of tokens to 1 in as few moves as possible.
